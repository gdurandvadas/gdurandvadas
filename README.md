## Hi there! 👋

I’m a Site Reliability Engineer and a Developer with over twelve years of experience in the IT industry. My career began as a SysAdmin, and during my time at Red Hat, I discovered my deep-rooted interest in managing complex systems.

I’m passionate about automation, architecture, security and development. I thrive in environments where I can tackle challenging projects requiring technical acumen, strategic roadmapping, and effective project management.

A core part of my professional journey has been stakeholder management. I’m proficient at aligning project objectives with business goals, ensuring all stakeholders are engaged and informed throughout the project lifecycle.

Moreover, I place a high value on communication. I enjoy teaching and mentoring, believing knowledge sharing is vital for team growth and success. I foster open communication and feedback, as I’m convinced these practices improve project outcomes and contribute to a positive and collaborative work culture.
