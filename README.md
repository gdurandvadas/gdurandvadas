# Hi there! 👋

My name is Gastón. I’m a Cloud Engineer and Developer.

I started my career as a SysAdmin, and soon after my experience working for Red Hat, I realized that I wanted cloud solutions to be part of my career. I love automation, architecture, security, development, and I’m obsessed with using/creating SaaS, PaaS.

I’m passionate about open-source. I think the license types enables all people to move technology forward.

Curiosity defines me. I love learning new things on my own, not only in technical aspects but also in the arts. I’m into movies-making, photography and music. I even had bands back in Buenos Aires where I played different instruments.

Last but not least, I thrive with open communications. I enjoy finding consensus with good sessions of discussions with people, and I strongly believe that documentation is the way to structure all kinds of data, so that can be revisited and updated.

### In a nutshell

- 🧮 I currently work at [Miro](https://miro.com/) as SRE DevOps Engineer (cloud stream)

    - [tf-status](https://github.com/gdurandvadas/tf-status): GitHub Webhook that publishes the plan results on the PRs
