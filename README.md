## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Site Reliability Engineer and a Developer with over twelve years of experience in the IT industry. My career began as a SysAdmin, and during my time at Red Hat, I discovered my deep-rooted interest in managing complex systems.

Iâ€™m passionate about automation, architecture, security and development. I thrive in environments where I can tackle challenging projects requiring technical acumen, strategic roadmapping, and effective project management.

A core part of my professional journey has been stakeholder management. Iâ€™m proficient at aligning project objectives with business goals, ensuring all stakeholders are engaged and informed throughout the project lifecycle.

Moreover, I place a high value on communication. I enjoy teaching and mentoring, believing knowledge sharing is vital for team growth and success. I foster open communication and feedback, as Iâ€™m convinced these practices improve project outcomes and contribute to a positive and collaborative work culture.
